By reading the following you'll learn in detail about our Privacy Policy. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data.

## Your Rights With Respect to Your Information

We apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). We recognizes all of the rights granted in this regulation, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:
- **Right to Know**. You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are- used, in this privacy policy.
- **Right of Access**. This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security, and processing of that- information.
- **Right to Correction**. You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
- **Right to Erasure / "To be Forgotten"**. This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by- extension, all our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using SalesTim services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data- deletion request may result in closing your account.
- **Right to Complain**. You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find- out more about this right, EU individuals should go to [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).
- **Right to Restrict Processing**. This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we- never have and never will sell your personal data).
- **Right to Object**. You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
- **Right to Portability**. You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
- **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making**. You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely- based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.

Many of these rights can be exercised in our product themselves or through the communication users receive (unsubscribe).

In any case you do any Subject Access Request (SAR), we engage to answer in no more than 30 days.

For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already collected including your user email address. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.

If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR, at [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [privacy@whatstack.io](privacy@whatstack.io).

## Changes & questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce to customers and publicly.

Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us at [privacy@whatstack.io](privacy@whatstack.io) and we'll be happy to answer them!
